# ScyllaDB Module Outputs
# Add any specific outputs here later if needed.
# For example, to output the ScyllaDB cluster service name or IP:
# output "scylla_cluster_service_name" {
#   description = "The name of the ScyllaDB cluster service."
#   value       = kubernetes_manifest.scylla_cluster.object.metadata.name # This might vary based on actual service created by operator
# }
